## üî¨ Research Gap

Current IoT-based systems offer effective outdoor tracking using GPS, but they often lack accuracy indoors due to signal attenuation. Additionally, many existing systems generate false alerts when patients are accompanied by caregivers. DementiaGuard overcomes these limitations with a **Bluetooth-based travel mode** and a **combined GPS-RF tracking system**.

| Feature                 | Existing Systems   | DementiaGuard      |
|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Indoor Tracking**      | Limited accuracy   | **RF-Based Precision** |
| **Outdoor Tracking**     | GPS only           | **GPS + RF**       |
| **Travel Mode**          | No                 | **Bluetooth Enabled** |
| **Push Notifications**   | Limited            | **Real-Time via FCM** |
| **SOS Alerts**           | Some               | **Emergency Button** |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy

DementiaGuard ensures the security and privacy of patient data with:
- **Data Encryption:** All data in transit and at rest is encrypted using the latest encryption standards.
- **Secure Authentication:** Access to the system is restricted to authorized caregivers and healthcare providers.
- **HIPAA Compliance:** The system is designed to comply with healthcare regulations.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

We plan to introduce the following features in future iterations:
- **AI-Based Cognitive Monitoring:** AI algorithms to detect early cognitive decline in patients.
- **Machine Learning for Therapy:** Personalization of cognitive exercises using machine learning.
- **Expanded Market:** Deploying DementiaGuard across hospitals and caregiving centers globally.
